# stopwatch
This is a stopwatch/timer web application created using jQuery. Once the app is started, you can either use the stop watch or the timer. When using the stop watch, each lap recorded will be displayed at the bottom of the time. When using the timer, an alarm sound would sound whenever the timer ends.
